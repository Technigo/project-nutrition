# Project Nutrition

This week's project is about building an site for which you can scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and nutritional information.

I chocie to display nutriant infromation and package picures. 

We built a component that uses [quagga](https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS) to access your webcam to use it to scan products, and your app should use Redux as a global state store.
