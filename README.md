# Project Nutrition

This project was all about building an app which scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and nutritional information. We used Open world facts API.

## The problem

The project went well, however it was a bit tricky to be able "to see" that we should create a reducer for the loading state. But since Redux is a pretty new concept we will most likely become better at seeing that over time.
