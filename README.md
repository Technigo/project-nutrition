# Project Nutrition

This week Johanna and I did a pair-programming project for Technigo bootcamp and made a web app that scans the barcode of food products and tell if it's produced in Sweden.

## The problem

Getting started with the project was the hardest part, since we had to figure out how the pre-coded qugga for the scanner would work with the rest of our code. But we are quite happy with the final result and that we also made a use of thunk and Lottie!
