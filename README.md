# Project Nutrition

This was a pair-programming project, with the aim to build an app which scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and nutritional information.

## The problem

For the project we used React and Redux to build our app. For the project we practiced on building and structuring the store, to make it suitable for our data and our app. To handle the API calls we used thunks. To scan the barcode we used Quagga. To be able to use Quagga the camera focus and the lighting has to be good, so to be able to use the app in several conditions we added the option of manuallly input the barcode. With more time it would have been interesting to add some more user interaction to the app, like being able to select which nutritional information you want to recieve.
