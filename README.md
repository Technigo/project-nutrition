# Project 16 - Barcode scanner

Project week 16 @ Technigo Bootcamp 2020 was all about tying together the skills we've learnt to build an app which scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and nutritional information.

The Quagga component was started by the Technigo team and from there we were supposed to build and style our own food scanner site.
