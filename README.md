# Project Nutrition

This is a group project where we have put together the skills we've learnt to build an app which scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and nutritional information. 

## The problem

We have made two reducers files, we are only using one though, but we can easily connect the other reducer to make a thuk which was our plan. The dispatch is ready to use but if we had more time we would have made a loading spinner for the page. 

We have used data from the Open World Facts API to fetch data to the user. And we collect the data from the user's input and send it to the API to collect the correct information. The API had different info in different product documentation so there might me missing info about some products, but the picture should always show. 


If we had more time we would have made sure that the information we rendered would exist on every product's documentation but since it differed so much it was hard to find the right info.
