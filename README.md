A food app that where you can scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve information about your product.


The app is built with a component to access the webcam with [quagga](https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS), it uses the camera to scan products. The app is built with Redux as a global state store and making API calls with thunks from openfoodfacts.org, the app is styled with style-comnponents.
Next step would be to implemented so that it would be possible to add mulitple products and to store each product on information cards and used Routes to have a multiple page app.
