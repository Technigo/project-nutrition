# Project Nutrition

This was a project in the Technigo Bootcamp. We used React Redux and Thunks to fetch data from Open Food Facts when scanning the barcode on a food product. 

## The problem

The biggest challenge was to connect the different techniques and to understand the usage of thunks. We struggeled to get the data to show as we wanted, the API was inconsistent.
