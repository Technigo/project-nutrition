# Project Nutrition

For this project we built a site that checks if a product is vegan and/or vegetarian. This is done by using the scanner or manually typing a barcode into an input field. 

## The problem

We started with sketching to get an understanding of the design, the different components and which ones could be reused. We used Open World Facts API, thunk, Quagga, React Redux and style components to built our project. We used reusable components for our buttons.
