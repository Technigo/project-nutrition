#Project Nutrition :apple:

In this project I have built a barcode scanner app used for scanning the barcodes of food products and retriving product name, information and if there are any allergens registrered on https://world.openfoodfacts.org/. 

I built the app using  Open world facts api to fetch the product information. I also have used quagga to access the webcam to scan the barcodes of the products. The styling is made with CSS and flexbox. Fot the frontend I used Redux (Reducers and actions with selectors and dispatching actions).

If I had more time, I would try to use the API more to see if I could of done something more with it, for example calculate the nutrition values and ingredients for diabetes or any other purpose. I would also spend even more time on styling, and used styled components.
