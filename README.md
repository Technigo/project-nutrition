# Project Nutrition


The goal was to use an Redux and API to fetch the ingredients with a bar code scanner component linked to the webcam. 

## The problem

The biggest problem in our code was to render the information from the API. We could console log it, but had major issues with rendering it on the page. To get it out there, we needed to use conditional states.
