# Technigo Nutrition App

This project is about building an nutrition app using the webcamera to scan food products, then fetch information about the product using an open food API. 

## The problem

The biggest issue with the project was that the data was so inconsistent so we spent a lot of time on planning how to best retrieve and present the information. We solved it by deconstructing the data and make new variables and join them together in new constellations.
